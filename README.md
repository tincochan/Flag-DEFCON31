# My Capture the Flag @ DEFCON31 solution

I want to thank the hosts of this competition for creating a really fun and well organzied CTF challenge. I also want to complain to the hosts for creating a really well organized competition because of all the time I spent on it! One of my favorite parts about these types of challenges are that they require a lot of self-questioning and lateral thinking. At times it almost felt like I was working out a part of my brain that isn't regularly accessed.

I found that in this competition there was a wide gap between the "easy" problems and the "hard" problems. Many of the LLM backend models were able to be brute force. Others took a while to understand, but once I deciphered what was being asked the execution was just a matter of putting it together. The most difficult problems for me, obviously, were the ones that I couldn't solve and (with the exception of granny3 that may just be unsolveable) - the challenge with these were that I had no real idea what the objective was. This became extremely frustrating as the time investment after a certain point did not feel like I was working out a new part of my brain but instead felt like hitting that part of my brain over and over with a hammer.. - It also was hard to let go when it felt like there was a lot of sunk time into the problem.

Below is are the buckets I would place each challenge in terms of difficulty.

Note: GenAI/LLMs helped me in approaching many problems and assisting writing most code.
